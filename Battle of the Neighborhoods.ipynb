    "Lee is an incoming graduate student slated to study at Columbia University in New York. After securing his visa and plane tickets, he now has to decide where to rent an apartment for the duration of his stay. Fortunately, he is not constrained by price, as he and his family are well-off; however, he predicts that during his stay in New York, he will likely be unable to eat non-Korean food in a regular manner. That is, it is essential that he lives in a neighborhood with a) a number of Korean restaurants and b) Korean restaurants that have been given high ratings. Since he will be studying in Upper Manhattan, renting an apartment beyond Manhattan is out of the question for Lee. In an attempt to inform his decision-making, Lee asks John to assist is looking for a neighborhood fitting Lee's requirements."
